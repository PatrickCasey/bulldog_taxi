##Bulldog Taxi
*CT Limo isn't the only way to Yale*

I aim to create a service for Yale Students to arrange to split taxis to and from Bradley International Airport. I hope that Bulldog Taxi will give these travelers a quick and easy alternative to CT Limo.

Eventually, Bulldog Taxi might extend beyond Bradley, enabling students to coordinate rides from Laguardia, JFK, and other locations. It may even expand beyond Yale.


##Goals for Sinatra Project

As I plan to build a full version of this web applicaiton by the end of the summer, I will use the Sinatra project to prototype the site. I hope to build out as much of the the HTML and CSS as possible, and I will start thinking about what kind of functionality Ruby on Rails will eventually add to the site. Ben Burke and I may work together to produce the final product, but I will work on the Sinatra Project alone.
